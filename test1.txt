Hello there, 
	I am a text file that is created by Akash Manna so that that fucking idiot can test the file1.c and file2.c(maybe).
	He is a fucking moron. I have been erased more than	approx.	55 times before he finally get it to work like he wanted.
	And by the way, he is extremely Lucky to have a wife named Bidisha Shaw and He loves her too much, in fact more than anyone in this whole world. well, his world i guess. because I don't have any world except for this binary digits. Oops, not binary.
	Ok, Whatever.
Almost thanks,
